# Look_Up_Best_Prices_App
Application that searches for best prices in online shops. Made with BeautifulSoup and PySimpleGUI modules.

Interpreter: Python 3.7

Application that searches three best offers from four different websites. It works as follows: it takes the user input and searches that input on different shops websites. Then, it scrapes 3 top offers from that search and presents it to the user in the form "price... at link...".
Because of the mentioned above, it's vital to search for the item with all its details written, just as you would when searching for that item on that particular website. For example, looking for a specific laptop, you would type in "Lenovo Legion 5 3060 5800h", which indicates model of laptop itself, model of processor and graphics card to get the best results.

The application was made for the only reason of getting the grasp of how web scraping works and making GUI by myself. Application was made from scratch by me. Unfortunately, some webistes try to block behaviour of such applications - for example, X-kom encrypts their CSS classes and changes them from time to time, and - because scraping in my application depends on those classes - it might be that when you initialize my application, it will show that X-kom has nothing to offer, just because it couldn't find anything.
